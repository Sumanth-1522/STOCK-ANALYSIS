# STOCK-ANALYSIS
# Stock Market Analysis Project

## 📑 Overview
This project involves analyzing stock market data to identify trends, patterns, and insights using **data analysis techniques** and **linear regression**. The data is extracted using an API key, cleaned, processed, and visualized to help understand stock market dynamics.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Extract real-time stock market data using APIs.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key metrics.
- Apply **linear regression** to predict stock trends.
- Visualize stock performance through dynamic dashboards.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data extraction, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing linear regression.
- **Power BI/Tableau**: For creating dashboards (optional).
